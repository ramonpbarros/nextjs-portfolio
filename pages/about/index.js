      <p>
        I&#39;ve been living in San Diego for the past 14 years and during this
        time I had some experience working with mobile development, but mostly
        working on my own business. I was in the restaurant business for 5
        years, always applying technical tools in order to increase sales. I
        earned a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the University
        of California San Diego, with newly developed skills. With a focus on
        front-end and back-end web development, I was able to test my skills
        building different projects either by myself or in groups. With each
        project, my goal is to best engage my audience for an impactful
        user-experience.
